		***** Dynamo Framework - Update Source Code Version *****
		==========================================================

- Dynamo Framework project is managed by Maven build system. 
- The Top level pom.xml file contains the latest version number.
- All the sub-modules in the Dynamo Framework project will have the same version number as the top-level POM.
- To update the version number of the project, we use the Maven Release 
	Plugin - http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html

Steps: (For example, to change version from 1.0 to 2.0-SNAPSHOT)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Change the version number of top-level pom.xml to 2.0-SNAPSHOT

2. In shell prompt, issue the command 'mvn release:update-versions' (without quotes)

<The plugin will enter an interactive mode prompting for the version to set>

4. At the first prompt, enter '2.0-SNAPSHOT' as the value (without quotes).

5. Repeat the same (i.e, enter 2.0-SNAPSHOT) for all prompts to update the version numbers for all sub modules in the project.

6. Issue the command 'mvn clean' (without quotes) to remove the target folders in all the sub-modules.

7. To ensure that version numbers for all sub-modules are updated, use an editor like STS and search for the text '1.0' 
	(without quotes) in all the pom.xml files' version attribute. If there are any, just manually change them to 2.0-SNAPSHOT. This step is 
	required only if the sub modules are not properly categorized as a child of the parent project module.

8. Build the project using command 'mvn clean package' (without quotes) to generate the artifacts with the updated version.
